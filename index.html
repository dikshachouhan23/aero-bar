             About:
          </h3>
          <p>
             Aero chocolate, which is renowned for its distinctive bubbly texture, is an aerated chocolate bar <br> (i.e., chocolate with air bubbles in it) first introduced to the world in 1935. The company responsible <br> for this invention was called Rowntree’s out of North of England, and they called it “new chocolate” <br> In the first year after this chocolate bar was launched, the demand grew across the UK, and sales <br> accelerated beyond expectations.
            
            <p>
              Soon enough, the “New Chocolate” reached New York City, marking the beginning of its international <br> journey in 1936. In 1988, Rowntree’s was acquired by Nestlé, a Swiss multinational corporation,<br> becoming Nestlé UK. Over time, the Aero brand made its way to numerous other countries, such as <br> Canada, Australia, South Africa and Japan. Nowadays, “Aero” offers a wide range of flavours and <br>dessert variations across the globe.

            <h3> What is Special About This Chocolate: </h3>
            <p>
                In general, Aero chocolates have:
                <ul>
                    <li>faster melting experience</li>
                    <li>lighter weight</li>
                    <li>bubbly structure</li>
                    <li> less calory per portion</li>
                    <li>more intense flavour experience</li>
                </ul>
                Aerated chocolate bars melt faster than regular chocolate because of the many tiny pockets within their <br> foamy texture. Moreover, based on research, those tiny bubbles can lead to a more intense flavour experience. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                 With such an effect on the taste and feel of the product, controlling the bubble size and their even distribution <br> across the chocolate would be an important factor. Efforts to better control the bubbles have even led to <br> experiments under zero-gravity conditions.
